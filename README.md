  ## Description
  For this app I wanted to create a note taker that allowed the user to take and save notes to a server. I also wanted the user to be able to delete the note once it was completed or no longer needed. 

  ## Installation
  No installation instructions are required. Just visit the url and start taking notes!

  ## Usage
  Once the user visits the deployed url they will be presented with a welcome screen. The user will then click the get started button and will be taken to the notes page. The user can then type their notes and the save icon will appear in the top right corner when the title and text of the note is filled in. Once the note is saved the note will display on the left side with the note data and a delete button next to the note. Once the note is no longer needed the delete button can be selected and the note will be deleted.

  ## Contribution
